//! Frontmost-app detection: which app is the paste target right now, so the
//! cleanup layer can format the output for the medium (email vs. text vs. chat).
//!
//! On macOS this reads `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` — the identity of the
//! focused app is public information and needs **no** extra TCC permission
//! (unlike reading the window's text, which would need Accessibility). The pill
//! overlay is non-activating, so the app the user is dictating into stays
//! frontmost; we capture its bundle id at record-start (Fn down).

/// Bundle id of the frontmost application — the paste target — e.g.
/// `com.apple.mail`. Returns `None` when it can't be determined or when
/// WhimprFlow itself is frontmost (so we don't format for our own Hub window).
