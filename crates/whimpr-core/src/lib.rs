//! `whimpr-core` — the platform-agnostic brain of WhimprFlow.
//!
//! Everything here is shared verbatim between macOS and Windows. Native concerns
//! (the hotkey hook, text injection, accessibility reads) live in the sidecar; the
//! ASR and cleanup-LLM implementations live in their own crates and plug in behind
//! the [`asr`] and [`cleanup`] trait seams defined here.
//!
//! What is implemented so far (M0/M1 foundation): the dictation [`state`] machine.
//! Subsequent milestones fill in the audio pipeline, ASR/cleanup traits, dictionary,
//! settings, and storage modules.
